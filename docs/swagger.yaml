      summary: Initiate Payment
      description: >-
        This API call lets the merchants initiate payments.
        The `merchantSerialNumber` (MSN) specifies which sales unit the payment is for.
        Payments are uniquely identified with the `merchantSerialNumber` and `orderId` together.
        The merchant-provided `orderId` must be unique per sales unit.
        Once the transaction is successfully initiated in Vipps, you will receive a
        response with a URL that will direct the customer to the Vipps landing page
        (when using a laptop/desktop), or app-switch to Vipps (when using a phone).
        The landing page detects if the request comes from a mobile or laptop/desktop device,
        and if on a mobile device automatically switches to the Vipps app, if it is installed.
        The merchant may also pass the optional 'isApp: true' parameter that will make Vipps
        respond with a app-switch deeplink that will take the customer directly
        to the Vipps app. This is normally not necessary, as Vipps handles this automatically.
        URLs passed to Vipps must validate, see the API guide.
        The URLs must use HTTPS.

        The transaction text is not optional and is used as a proof of delivery
        (tracking code, consignment number etc.). In a case of direct capture,
        both the reservation and the capture are executed in a single operation.
        It is important to check the response, and the capture is only

            Required for Vipps Hurtigkasse (express checkout) payments. This callback URL will be
            used by Vipps to inform the merchant that the user has revoked
            his/her consent: This Vipps user does not want the merchant to
            store or use his/her personal information any longer. Required by GDPR.
            Vipps will add `/v2/consents/{userId}` to the end or this URL.
            URLs passed to Vipps must validate, see the API guide.
            We don't send requests to all ports, so to be safe use common ports such as: 80, 443, 8080.
            The URL must use HTTPS.

            Vipps will use the fallBack URL to redirect the Vipps user to the
            merchant’s confirmation page once the payment is completed in Vipps.
            This is normally the “success page”, although the “fallback” name
            is ambiguous (the same URL is also used if payment was not successful).
            In other words: This is the URL Vipps sends the Vipps user back to.
            The page must handle both successful payments and payment failures.
            URLs passed to Vipps must validate, see the API guide.
            The URL must use HTTPS, or a custom URL scheme like "myapp://"".
          maxLength: 255
