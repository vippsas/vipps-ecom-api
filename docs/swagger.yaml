        The access token endpoint is used to get the JWT (JSON Web Token) that
        must be passed in every API request in the Authorization header.
        The access token is a base64-encoded string value that must be

        Payments are uniquely identified with the merchantSerialNumber and orderId together.
        The merchant-provided orderId must be unique per sales channel.
        Once the transaction is successfully initiated in Vipps, you will receive a
        response with a `fallBack` URL which will direct the customer to the Vipps landing page.
        The landing page detects if the request comes from a mobile or laptop/desktop device,
        and if on a mobile device automatically switches to the Vipps app if it is intalled.
        The merchant may also pass the 'isApp: true' parameter that will make Vipps
        respond with a app-switch deeplink that will take the customer directly
        to the Vipps app.

        The API allows a merchant to do a refund of already captured
        transaction. There is an option to do a partial refund of the captured
        amount. Refunded amount cannot be larger than captured. Timeframe for
        issuing a refund for a payment is 365 days from the date payment has
        been captured. If the refund payment service call is called after the
        refund timeframe, service call will respond with an error. Refunded
        funds will be transferred from the merchant account to the customer
        credit card that was used in payment flow. Pay attention that in order
        to perform refund, there must be enough funds at merchant settlements
        account.
