    # Vipps API Developer Documentation

    Vipps eCommerce API gives merchant a great control over Vipps payment
    lifecycle. It gives the possibility to initiate payment from mobile app and
    webshop. It also enables the merchant to affect payment flow by utilizing
    functions like payment reservation, capture, cancellation and refunding.

    # Use case scenarios

    In order to ease the integration with Vipps and get a better understanding
    of API functionality and usage of some typical scenarios are presented.

    # API Calls flow

    This section will explain how merchants can start using Vipps APIs and get
    access to API credentials.

    During the merchant’s onboarding process in Vipps, the merchant receives a
    username and a password to login into the Merchant Developer Portal (manual
    to use merchant developer portal can be found here). Once logged in to the
    developer portal, the merchant needs to register an application to generate
    a JWT access token (also called Authorization Token) and use the token in the authorization header of the
    request. The diagram below shows the integration flow between merchant and
    Vipps server.

    All communication with the Vipps ecommerce API has to be authenticated via
    JWT access token. To get this access token and use it in API calls merchant
    should follow the steps below:
     * Merchant logs into the Developer portal and registers an application that will consume Vipps APIs. On successful registration, it will receive application credentials (ClientId and ClientSecret).
     * Merchant application uses the clientid and clientsecret to get a JWT access token from APIM. JWT access token is a base 64 encoded string value that needs to be used as a bearer token in the request header.
     * Merchant application will have to use this JWT access token, APIM subscription key and App Id(clientid) along with other request parameters while calling a Vipps API.
     * APIM validates the JWT access token and subscription key. If the token is invalid it responds with 401 unauthorized while if it is valid, the request is forwarded to Vipps. Vipps process the request and produce a corresponding response which is sent back to merchant application via APIM.
    # Idempotency

    All API requests in Vipps eCommerce can be retried without any side effects
    by providing idempotent key in a header of  the request. For example, in
    case the request fails because of network error it can safely be retried
    with the same idempotent key. Idempotent key is generated by merchant.

      ```
      X-Request-Id: slvnwdcweofjwefweklfwelf"
      ```

    # Authentication

    Every API call is authenticated and authorized based on the application
    Authorization token (JWT Bearer token) and APIM subscription key
    (Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key). In addition, APP Id need to be provided in
    request header in order to authenticate the application the merchant has
    registered. Following headers are required to be there in every API request
    to successfully authenticate every API call.

      | **Header Name** | **Header Value** | **Description** |
      | :-------------------------- | :--------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
      | Authorization | Bearer 'jwt_access_token'' | type: Authorization token<br>Value: Access token is obtained by registering merchant backend application in Merchant Developer Portal. |
      | Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key | Base 64 encoded string | Subscription key for eCommerce product.<br>This can be found in User Profile page on Merchant developer portal after merchant account is created |

    # Responses

    Vipps has a series of responses depending on the state of the transaction. For more information please read [this segment](https://github.com/alfmags/vipps-ecom-api/blob/master/vipps-ecom-api.md#response-codes) in the manual.

        merchantApplicationId (X-App-ID), merchantSerialNumber and orderId. The

        the Vipps landing page. The landing page will have functionality to
        identify and differentiate request coming from mobile browser/desktop
        browser. The fallback (URL) attribute should pass the Apache Commons [UrlValidator](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-validator/apidocs/org/apache/commons/validator/routines/UrlValidator.html). The URL should already be encoded when making the API-call.

        The API allows a merchant to do a refund of already captured
        transaction. There is an option to do a partial refund of the captured
        amount. Refunded amount cannot be larger than captured. Timeframe for
        issuing a refund for a payment is 365 days from the date payment has
        been captured. If the refund payment service call is called after the
        refund timeframe, service call will respond with an error. Refunded
        funds will be transferred from the merchant account to the customer
        credit card that was used in payment flow. Pay attention that in order
        to perform refund, there must be enough funds at merchant settlements
