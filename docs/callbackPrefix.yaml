        This API call allows Vipps to send the transaction details.
        For regular eCom payments, the order and transaction details will be shared.
        For Vipps Hurtigkasse (express checkout) payments, it will provide user and shipping details,
        in addition to the order and transaction details.
        Vipps will add `/v2/payments/{orderId}` to the end of this URL.
        URLs passed to Vipps must be validated, see the
        [API guide](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/ecom-api/vipps-ecom-api/#url-validation).
        We do not send requests to all ports, so use common ports such as: 80, 443, 8080.
        The URL must use HTTPS.
