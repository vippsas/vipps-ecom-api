      summary: Fetch Shipping Cost & Method (for Vipps Hurtigkasse (express checkout))
      description: >-
        This API endpoint on the merchant side allows Vipps to get the shipping
        cost and method, based on the provided address and product details.
        The primary use of this service is to support Vipps Hurtigkasse (express checkout),
        where Vipps must present the shipping cost and method to the user.
        Vipps will add `/v2/payments/{orderId}/shippingDetails` to the end of
        this URL.
        There is a *10 second timeout* for these requests, to ensure a good
        user experience, and thus requires a quick reply from the merchant's
        server for successful payments.
        URLs passed to Vipps must be validated, see the
        [API guide](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/ecom-api/vipps-ecom-api/#url-validation).
        We do not send requests to all ports, so use common ports such as: 80, 443, 8080.
        The URL must use HTTPS.

            The token provided by the merchant in the initiate payment request
            as `authToken` (an optional parameter).
            Vipps uses this token when making calls to the merchant's servers.
