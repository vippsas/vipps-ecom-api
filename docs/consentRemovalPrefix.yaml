      summary: Remove User Consent (for Vipps Hurtigkasse (express checkout))
      description: >-
        This API endpoint on the merchant side allows Vipps to send consent-removal
        requests to the merchant. When receiving requests, the merchant
        is obliged to remove the user details permanently, as per the GDPR guidelines.
        Vipps will add `/v2/consents/{userId}` to the end of this URL.
        URLs passed to Vipps must validate, see the
        [API guide](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/ecom-api/vipps-ecom-api/#url-validation).
        We do not send requests to all ports, so use common ports such as: 80, 443, 8080.
        The URL must use HTTPS.
