# Postman

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a common tool for working with REST APIs.
We offer a [Postman Collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collection) to make development easier.
See the [Postman documentation](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/) for more information about using Postman.

By following the steps below, you can make calls to all the
endpoints, and see the full `request` and `response` for each call.

We also have a short [getting started guide to Postman](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/postman-guide.md).

## Setting up Postman

### Step 1: Get the Postman Collection

Import the collection by following the steps below:

1. Click `Import` in the upper-left corner.
2. Import the [vipps-ecom-api-postman-collection.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vippsas/vipps-ecom-api/master/tools/vipps-ecom-api-postman-collection.json) file.

### Step 2: Import the Postman Environment

1. Click `Import` in the upper-left corner.
2. Import the [vipps-ecom-api-postman-environment.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vippsas/vipps-ecom-api/master/tools/vipps-ecom-api-postman-environment.json) file.

### Step 3: Set up Postman Environment

1. Click the down arrow, next to the "eye" icon in the top-right corner, and select the environment you have imported.
2. Click the "eye" icon and, in the dropdown window, click `Edit` in the top-right corner.
3. Fill in the `Current Value` for the following fields to get started. For the first three keys, go to *Vipps Portal* > *Utvikler* ->  *Test Keys*.
   - `client_id` - Merchant key is required for getting the access token.
   - `client_secret` - Merchant key is required for getting the access token.
   - `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` - Merchant subscription key.
   - `merchantSerialNumber` - Merchant id.
   - `mobileNumber` - The mobile number for the test app profile you have received or registered.
   - `amount` - The desired amount Integer value minimum 100 in Ã˜re.

### Step 4: Run the examples

#### 1. A simple payment

1. Send request `Get Access Token`. This provides you with access to the API.

   [`POST:/accesstoken/get`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Authorization%20Service/fetchAuthorizationTokenUsingPost)

1. Send request `Initiate Payment`. This is to demonstrate a simple payment.

   `Ctrl+click` on the link that appears and it will take you to the website where you can enter your test phone number and complete the payment authorization in the Vipps app in your mobile test environment.

   [`POST:/v3/psppayments/init/`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Vipps%20eCom%20API/initiatePaymentV3UsingPOST)

1. Send request `Get Payment Details` for information about this payment. The `orderId` in this Postman example is set for the previous call.

   [`GET:/ecomm/v2/payments/{orderId}/details`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Vipps%20eCom%20API/getPaymentDetailsUsingGET)

#### 2. An express checkout payment (*Vipps Hurtigkasse*)

1. Send request `Get Access Token`, if you haven't already.

   [`POST:/accesstoken/get`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Authorization%20Service/fetchAuthorizationTokenUsingPost)

1. Send request `Initiate Payment - Express Checkout`. This demonstrates the type of payment where the user selects their shipping methods within the Vipps app instead of on the website. To enable this functionality, you provide the object `staticShippingDetails` with your relevant details in the body of the call.

   `Ctrl+click` on the link that appears and it will take you to the website where you can enter your test phone number and complete the payment authorization in the Vipps app in your mobile test environment.

   [`POST:/v3/psppayments/init/`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Vipps%20eCom%20API/initiatePaymentV3UsingPOST)

1. Send request `Get Payment Details` for information about this payment. The `orderId` in this Postman example is set for the previous call.

   [`GET:/ecomm/v2/payments/{orderId}/details`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Vipps%20eCom%20API/getPaymentDetailsUsingGET)

#### 3. Getting userinfo

1. Send request `Get Access Token`, if you haven't already.

   [`POST:/accesstoken/get`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Authorization%20Service/fetchAuthorizationTokenUsingPost)

1. Send request `Initiate Payment - Profile flow`. Here, the `scope` object contains the information types that you want access to, separated by spaces (e.g., "name address email phoneNumber birthDate").

   `Ctrl+click` on the link that appears and it will take you to the website where you can enter your test phone number and complete the payment authorization in the Vipps app in your mobile test environment.

   If you have not already provided access to these scopes, you will be requested to authorize the access.

   [`POST:/v3/psppayments/init/`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Vipps%20eCom%20API/initiatePaymentV3UsingPOST)

1. Send request `Get Payment Details` for information about this payment.

   Here, the user identifier, `sub`, is retrieved from the response and set as a variable.

   [`GET:/ecomm/v2/payments/{orderId}/details`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Vipps%20eCom%20API/getPaymentDetailsUsingGET)

1. Send request `Get Userinfo`. This uses the `sub` variable from the previous call.

   [`GET:/vipps-userinfo-api/userinfo/{sub}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Vipps%20eCom%20API/getUserinfo)

See [Userinfo in the eCommerce API guide](vipps-ecom-api.md#userinfo) for more information.
