# Vipps eCommerce API: How It Works

This is how payment with Vipps eCommerce works.

## The ecommerce payment process

## 1. Pay with Vipps

The user chooses “Pay with Vipps”, either in the checkout, or on the product page (express checkout) of a merchant’s website or app.

## 2. The Vipps landing page (If customer started on desktop)

If the payment was started on a desktop device the user will be sent to the Vipps landing page.
The user confirms their number, and is prompted to log in to Vipps.

If the payment was started from a mobile device, the app wil automatically switch over to Vipps.

## 3. Confirm payment in Vipps

The user receives a push notification on their phone. They log in to Vipps, and confirm the payment. The payment is reserved and the user gets a receipt of the successful payment

For express checkout they also have to choose a shipping cost alternative.

The user is redirected back to the merchant’s store, and the order is confirmed.

## 6. Money in the bank

The payment is transferred to the merchant’s account. This may take 2-3 days depending on your bank.
