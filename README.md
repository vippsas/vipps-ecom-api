**Important:** We strongly recommend that all new integrations use the new
[ePayment API](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/epayment-api).

The eCommerce API (eCom API) allows you to create various online payment flows,
including express checkout. Initiate payments, get payment details, capture
payments, and refund payments.

The eCom API supports
[Vipps på nett](https://vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/ta-betalt-paa-nett/ta-betalt-paa-nett/),
[Vipps Checkout](https://vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/ta-betalt-paa-nett/vipps-checkout/),
[Vipps i kassa (POS)](https://vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/ta-betalt-i-butikk/vipps-i-kassa/),
native apps and other solutions.
