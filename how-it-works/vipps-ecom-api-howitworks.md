This is how payment with Vipps eCommerce works.

## The ecommerce payment process

## 1. Pay with Vipps

The user chooses “Pay with Vipps”, either in the checkout, or on the product page (express checkout) of a merchant’s website or app.

## 2. The Vipps landing page (If customer started on desktop)

If the payment was started on a desktop device the user will be sent to the Vipps landing page.
The user confirms their number, and is prompted to log in to Vipps.

If the payment was started from a mobile device, the app wil automatically switch over to Vipps.
